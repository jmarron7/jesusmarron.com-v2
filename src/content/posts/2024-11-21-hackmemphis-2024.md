tldr: "I had a ton of fun spending the weekend with other driven and talented devs. We didn't win for our category but lots of people seemed to like our idea and prototype. We still believe we have a good idea and are proud of what we accomplished in 36 hours."

Hackathons are one of those things I always heard about when I first was really diving into tech and never really understood it. I didn't get the appeal of spending several days doing what seemed like free work. It wasn't until later when I found solving problems and building stuff for fun that it all clicked for me.

Several years ago I joined the online dev group [Code Connector](https://codeconnector.io/) and started chatting with other people barely starting off in their programming journey and some that had years of experience. After a while I learned about [DevMemphis](https://devmemphis.org/), a local tech meetup group here in Memphis. I've been attending these local meetups for over a little over 2 years now but have always just kept to myself and didn't partake in the social aspect of it. There were a few times when a couple of hackathons in the city were brought up but I never felt confident enough to sign up for them until this year when [HackMemphis](https://hackmemphis.com/) was announced.

HackMemphis is a city hackathon where both technical and non-technical people collaborate for over 36 hours to develop and present innovative solutions to 3 civic challenges for the City of Memphis: reducing blight in neighborhoods, improving transportation for job access, and using new AI and Smart City technology. HackMemphis this year took part from November 15 to November 17.

## Day 1: Kickoff, Networking, and Team Formation

I arrived at the University of Memphis FedEx Institute of Technology at 4:30pm. It was still early for registration but there were already about 20 people inside when I walked in. I felt nervous and excited at the same time. 

I found some people that I knew from either Code Connector or DevMemphis and caught up with them as we talked to other fellow hackers. Working remote has its perks but there's something energetic about being in a room full of people ready to solve problems together.

Eventually, we ended up forming in line and getting registered and picked up our hackathon swag. There was a nice kickoff ceremony with words from the different organizations that hosted the event and even some words from Mayor Young.

The crowd was excited and you could see everyone start to conjure up ideas as the speakers presented and gave more information on the 3 different challenge areas that we given for the hackathon:

- [Blight & Neighborhood Improvement](https://innovatememphis.com/tackling-blight-at-the-2024-city-hackathon/)
- [Transportation for Workforce Development](https://innovatememphis.com/improving-workforce-transportation-at-the-2024-city-hackathon/)
- [AI & Smart City Technology](https://innovatememphis.com/using-ai-and-smart-city-technology-at-the-2024-city-hackathon/)

After the kickoff ceremony, we all were provided with dinner and were encouraged to talk with other people to get a feel of what teams we wanted to form, what challenge area we wanted to tackle, and what skills did we want to utilize for the weekend. I was initially really interested in the transportation challenge and I knew I wanted to get some actual development work done so I made sure to talk to several people to find either a good idea or a group of good people.

I talked with data analysts, other developers, and even non-technical people who had a lot of insight into the different programs currently in the city. Eventually, I ended up sticking with the original group of some of the other CodeConnector and DevMemphis members - [JC Smiley](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jcsmileyjr/), [Tremaine McKinley](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tremaine-mckinley/), and [Coriano Harris](https://www.linkedin.com/in/corianoharris/).

At first, we were just brainstorming on ideas of what problem to solve. After several conversations and throwing out ideas, we came up with the loose idea of integrating gamification with the Open311 calls to allows city residents access to this data and to provide incentives for them to take on cases and bettering the city in the process.

There were several HackMemphis Coaches that we consulted with to validate and refine our idea. We ended up getting a lot of help from [Robert Crocker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertcrocker/) who helped us scope our idea and plan a lot of the features we wanted to implement for our prototype.

By the end of the night, we had an a challenge we wanted to tackle, a possible solution to this issue, a set of features to implement, a group of people motivated to start building, and a team name - **Blight Busters**.
